- The Snake Game with an A.I. (Made using python and turtle)

## How to use A.I.
- You can enable the AI whenever you like just by removing the hashtags in the #--add-ai--# sections(It eats your food so that you can't get it unless you reach the food before it does, also avoids any kind of rules).
- ```
    #-----add AI------#
    
    ai = AI(food)
    
    #-----add AI------#
  ```
- ```
   #-----add AI------#
    ai.move()
    ai.ai_move()
    #-----add AI------#
  ```
  
- Don't use the AI unless you wanna get bullied.

## Installation

- Install and run the game with just a single command!!
- ```git clone https://github.com/Bravo-ZR/The-Snake-Game/ && cd The-Snake_Game && python main.py```
## How to play
- Use up,down,left,right to control the snake, you can't go opposite directions.
## Fix
- If your game doesn't work and gives errors related to tkinter. You can try installing tkinter and turtle if you don't have them already.
